<h1>AISTATS*2012 Call for Breaking News Abstracts</h1>


<h2>Fifeteenth International Conference on <br>Artificial Intelligence
and Statistics</h2> <h3>April 21-23, 2012, La Palma, Canary
Islands</h3>

<p>This is the fifeteenth conference on Artificial Intelligence and
Statistics (AISTATS*2012), an interdisciplinary gathering of
researchers at the intersection of computer science, artificial
intelligence, statistics, and related areas.

<p>The Conference Programme will include invited talks, peer-reviewed
contributed talks and posters. These contributed talks and posters,
for which the submission date is October 14th, 2011, will be published
as full papers. However, in addition, as at the last European AISTATS,
some time at the conference will be set aside for "breaking news"
posters submitted on the basis of a one-page abstract.  These posters
may report on ongoing or unpublished projects, projects already
published elsewhere, partially developed ideas, negative results etc.,
and are meant as informal fora to encourage discussion.  Abstracts
should summarize and highlight why the projects will be of interest to
the AISTATS community.  The review process of these abstracts will be
very light-touch but presentation of these at the Conference will NOT
lead to publication in the Proceedings.

<p>Since its inception in 1985, the primary goal of this conference
has been to broaden research at the interface between artificial
intelligence and statistics.  Abstracts on all aspects of this
interface are strongly encouraged, including but not limited to:

<p>Solicited topics include, but are not limited to:

<ul>
  <li> Models and estimation (graphical models, causality, Gaussian processes, approximate inference, kernel methods, nonparametric models, statistical and computational learning theory, manifolds and embedding, sparsity and compressed sensing, ...)
  <li> Classification, regression, density estimation, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, clustering, topic models, ...

  <li> Structured prediction, relational learning, logic and probability
  <li> Reinforcement learning, planning, control
  <li> Game theory, no-regret learning, multi-agent systems
  <li> Algorithms and architectures for high-performance computation in AI and statistics
  <li> Software for and applications of AI and statistics
</ul>

For a more detailed list of keywords, see <a href="keywords.html">this page</a>.</p>


<h3>Submission Requirements for Breaking News Abstracts:</h3>

<p>Electronic submission of one-page double-column abstracts is
required.  Formatting and submission information can be found on the
AI and Statistics Conference page. Submissions will be considered if
they are received by 23:59, Friday February 10th, 2012, Universal Time
(Greenwich Mean Time).

<p>Abstracts will be lightly reviewed.  Acceptance notifications will
be emailed by February 24th.  These will be presented as posters at
the conference but will not be published.
