	 <p>The fifteenth international conference on Artificial
    Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2012) will be held on La Palma in the Canary Islands. AISTATS is an interdisciplinary gathering of
    researchers at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and related areas. Since its inception in 1985, the primary goal of AISTATS has been to broaden research in these fields by promoting the exchange of ideas among them. We encourage the submission of all papers which are in keeping with this objective.</p>
<p>This is the second edition of AISTATS to be held in Europe. The first edition, <a href="./aistats2010/">AISTATS 2010</a>, was a great success. A report by Mike Titterington on the meeting can be found in the IMS bulletin <a href="http://bulletin.imstat.org/wp-content/uploads/Bulletin39_7.pdf">here</a>. 

<p>If you would like to announce AISTATS 2012 in your department, here is a <a href="AISTATS_poster.pdf">poster</a> for the conference information (1 page, PDF).
