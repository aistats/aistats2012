<b>Patterns, Predictions and Personalised Medicine</b>

<p> Advances in gathering, storing, processing and retrieving data are transforming research in biomedicine and public health. These areas have conventionally relied on tools based on sampling with inductive rules to improve the generalisation of conclusions.  With current information-handling abilities, we can anticipate the recording of all relevant data from entire populations, making unnecessary the need for sampling and its framework of rules.

<p>The feasible move by governments and health agencies towards 'cradle to grave' electronic health records for entire populations opens up the prospect of intelligent systems able to identify health risks and useful interventions for population subsets and eventually for individual people. The development of intelligent technology to detect, evaluate and represent patterns in data will underpin these advances in health management.

<p>In the near term, applications are likely in the development of new medicines, perhaps with less reliance on a priori mechanistic knowledge, and greater use of pattern recognition to indicate where new discoveries might be made, stimulating new mechanistic insights. In medicines development, stratification of patient populations in clinical trials, before a product goes to market, has large potential to produce safe, effective and cost-effective therapeutics for diseases where current treatments are unsatisfactory. 

<p>Pattern recognition of predictors of disease susceptibility, responses to medicines, and more widely in the fields of nutrition and lifestyle, would transform our ability to prevent, cure or mitigate diseases, and our approach to the maintenance of health.

<p><b> Bio:</b> Gordon Duff graduated in Medicine from Oxford, and St Thomas's Hospital, London, where he also gained a PhD in Neuropharmacology.  He held junior faculty posts at Yale University and the Hughes Institute of Molecular Immunology at Yale before joining the Edinburgh Medical School in1984. In 1990 took up his present post of Florey Professor of Molecular Medicine at Sheffield, where he was Research Dean of the Faculty and Director of the Division of Genomic Medicine.  He currently chairs the Academic Health Sciences Centre of Trinity College Dublin, and the International SAB of the MRC Centre for Drug Safety Sciences at Liverpool.

<p>Previously Chairman of the UK's Committee on Safety of Medicines and its Biological Sub-committee, he has been Chairman of the UK's Commission on Human Medicines since 2005.  In 2006 he chaired the Secretary-of-State's Expert Scientific Group on Phase One Clinical Trials, following the disaster at Northwick Park Hospital. From 2002 to 2009 he was also Chairman of the National Biological Standards Board, overseeing the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control.  He is an advisor on Biological Medicines to the EU, and Chairman of the UK's Scientific Pandemic Influenza Advisory Committee. In 2009-10, he co-chaired, with Govt Chief Scientist, the Cabinet Office's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies during the pandemic flu outbreak. In 2010 he reviewed the UK's Organ Donor Register at the request of the Secretary-of-State. 

<p>He is an Honorary Fellow of St Peter's College, Oxford, Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences, Fellow of the Royal Colleges of Physicians of Edinburgh and London (Croonian Lecturer), and Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In 2007 he received a Knighthood for services to public health. </p>

<b>Alpha, Betti and the Megaparsec Universe:  Topology of the Cosmic Web</b>

<p>Over the past decades a clear paradigm has emerged as large
redshift surveys opened the window onto the distribution of matter in
our Local Universe: galaxies, intergalactic gas and dark matter exist
in a wispy weblike spatial arrangement consisting of dense compact
clusters, elongated filaments, and sheetlike walls, amidst large
near-empty void regions. The Cosmic Web is the fundamental spatial
organization of matter on scales of a few up to a hundred Megaparsec,
scales at which the Universe still resides in a state of moderate
dynamical evolution.

<p>While the complex intricate structure of the cosmic web contains a
wealth of cosmological information, its quantification has remained a
major challenge. In this lecture, we describe our effort to measure
key topological parameters. To this end, we resort to the homology of
the weblike structure, and determine the scale-dependent Betti
numbers. For 3-D structures they count the number of components,
tunnels and enclosed voids. Out study includes a study of persistence
and persistent homology, which entails the conceptual framework for
separating scales of a spatial structure. To infer this from the
discrete spatial galaxy distribution (or of particles in computer
models of cosmic structure formation) we extract the homology from
alpha shapes. Alphashapes were introduced by Edelsbrunner to formalize
the concept of "shape" for a spatial point dataset. At large value of
alpha corresponds to the convex hull of the dataset, while as alpha
shrinks the alphashape assumes cavities which may join to form tunnels
and voids.

<p>We have studied the alpha complex of the cosmic weblike point
patterns, in order to assess the signature of filaments, walls and
voids. The physical interpretation of the obtained scale-dependence of
Betti numbers is determined from a range of cellular point
distributions. The findings from the Voronoi clustering models is used
to analyze the outcome of cosmological N-body simulations and the SDSS
galaxy redshift survey.


<p><b>Bio:</b> Rien van de Weygaert studied astronomy and physics at
the University of Leiden, where he obtained his PhD cum laude in 1991
on "Voids and the Geometry of Large Scale Structure".  Subsequently,
he worked as an NSERC fellow at the Canadian Institute of Astrophysics
(CITA) in Toronto, Canada and as a research fellow at the Max Planck
Institut f&uuml;r Astrophysik in Garching, Germany before taking up a KNAW
fellowship at the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute at the University of
Groningen. Since 2004 he is professor of cosmological structure
formation at the Kapteyn Insitute. His research interests concern
cosmology, the large scale Universe and the formation of structure in
the Universe, as well as computational geometry and topology and
pattern recognition.  Within these research subjects he has had a
particular interest in the formation and dynamics of the Cosmic Web,
the complex network of interconnected filamentary galaxy associations
that pervades our universe on scales of tens to hundreds of million
lightyears, and the existence and evolution of voids, the large near
empty regions in between these structures.  For the analysis of this
structure, he has been working on a diverse array of tools based on
Voronoi and Delaunay tessellations and related geometric concepts,
finding that they provide a highly versatile means of tracing the
complex structures seen in the Universe.  Recently he started to
wander into the history of astronomy, via a research project on
world's oldest astronomical and mechanical computer, the Antikythera
mechanism from ancient Greek times.</p>

<b> Detection of correlations in high dimension</b>

<p>We consider the problem of finding information in high-dimensional noisy data.
Our goal is to understand the possibilities and limitations of such correlation
detection problems. The mathematical analysis reveals some interesting
phase transitions. We also discuss an interesting connection with random
geometric graphs.

<p><b>Bio:</b> G&aacute;bor Lugosi graduated in electrical engineering at the Technical
University of Budapest in 1987, and received his Ph.D. from the
Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1991. Since 1996, he has
been at the Department of Economics, Pompeu Fabra University.
In 2006 he became an ICREA research professor.
His research interest includes learning theory, nonparametric
statistics, inequalities in probability, random structures, and
information theory.</p>
