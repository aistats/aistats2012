<h1>AISTATS*2012 Call for Papers</h1>
<h2>Fifteenth International Conference on <br>Artificial Intelligence and Statistics</h2>
    <h3>April 21-23, 2012, La Palma, Canary Islands</h3>

    <p><b>See also <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/cfa.html">separate call</a> for Breaking News Abstracts</b>

<p>AISTATS is an interdisciplinary gathering of researchers at the
intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, machine
learning, statistics, and related areas. Since its inception in
1985, the primary goal of AISTATS has been to broaden research in
these fields by promoting the exchange of ideas among them. We
encourage the submission of all papers which are in keeping with this
objective
at <a href="http://www.aistats.org/">www.aistats.org</a>.</p>

<p>In the 2012 edition of AISTATS we are particularly encouraging
submissions with a focus on scientific data sets. Examples could
include astronomical data, biological data etc. These submissions have been assigned the keywords "scientific data analysis".

<p>The Conference Program will include invited talks, contributed
talks, and posters.  Contributed talks and posters will be selected
via a rigorous double-blind peer-review process.  Accepted papers will
be published in the AISTATS Conference Proceedings to be published as
a volume of JMLR Workshop and Conference Proceedings.</p>

<p>Some time at the conference will be set aside for "breaking news"
posters submitted on the basis of a one-page abstract.  These are
reports on ongoing or unpublished projects, projects already published
elsewhere, partially developed ideas, negative results etc, and are
meant as informal forums to encourage discussion.  The review process
of these posters will be very light-touch but presentation of these at
the Conference will not lead to publication in the Proceedings.</p>

<p>Solicited topics include, but are not limited to:

<ul>
  <li> Models and estimation (graphical models, causality, Gaussian processes, approximate inference, kernel methods, nonparametric models, statistical and computational learning theory, manifolds and embedding, sparsity and compressed sensing, ...)
  <li> Classification, regression, density estimation, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, clustering, topic models, ...

  <li> Structured prediction, relational learning, logic and probability
  <li> Reinforcement learning, planning, control
  <li> Game theory, no-regret learning, multi-agent systems
  <li> Algorithms and architectures for high-performance computation in AI and statistics
  <li> Software for and applications of AI and statistics
</ul>

For a more detailed list of keywords, see <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/keywords.html">this page</a>.</p>

<h3>Submission Requirements</h3>

<h3>Peer-Reviewed Papers:</h3>

<p>Electronic submission of papers is required. Papers may be up
to 8 double-column pages in length, <b>excluding</b> references;
formatting and submission information will be made available on the
conference website at <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/submit.html">submit.html</a>.

<p>Submissions will be considered if they are received by 23:59,
October 14th, 2011, UTC. See the conference website for
additional important
dates: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dates.html">dates.html</a>.

<p>All accepted papers will be presented at the Conference either as
contributed talks or as posters, and will be published in the AISTATS
Conference Proceedings. Papers for talks and posters will be
treated equally in publication.

<p>Submitted manuscripts should not have been previously published in
a journal or in the proceedings of a conference, and should not be
under consideration for publication at another conference at any point
during the AISTATS review process. It is acceptable to have a
substantially extended version of the submitted paper under
consideration simultaneously for journal publication, so long as the
journal version's planned publication date is in 2012 or later, the
journal submission does not interfere with AISTATS's right to publish
the paper, and the situation is clearly described at the time of
AISTATS submission. Please describe the situation in the
appropriate box on the submission page (and do not include author
information in the submission itself, to avoid accidental unblinding).
